# California-_House_Price_Preidiction_Using_ML
Developed a machine learning model with Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to forecast the price of homes in California. Regression analysis, feature engineering, and data cleansing were used to provide precise predictions.<br>

<h2>Dataset Description</h2><br>

The dataset used in this project is a housing dataset that contains information about various features related to housing prices in different areas. The dataset includes the following features:<br>
- median_income: Median income in the area<br>
- housing_age: Age of the houses<br>
- total_rooms: Total number of rooms in the houses<br>
- total_bedrooms: Total number of bedrooms in the houses<br>
- total_bathrooms: Total number of bathrooms in the houses<br>
- population: Population in the area<br>
- households: Number of households in the area<br>
- latitude: Latitude of the area<br>
- longitude: Longitude of the area<br>
- ocean_proximity: Proximity to the ocean (categorical feature)<br>
- median_house_value: Median house value in the area (target variable)<br>

This project focused on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques and investigated various socio-economic and housing-related factors' influence. The dataset underwent preprocessing and exploratory data analysis, uncovering insights such as the correlation between predictors and property value differentials. Through evaluating three models, the <b>RandomForestRegressor</b> emerged as the top performer, achieving an accuracy of <u><b>84.5%</b></u>. This study underscores the potential of machine learning in understanding and forecasting housing market trends, essential for informing real estate investment decisions and policy-making. Successful deployment offers practical avenues for optimizing pricing strategies and real estate management practices.
